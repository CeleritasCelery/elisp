This repository is a swarm for all the Elisp stuff I published.  Most
files will have licence information in it, which don't are licenced
under the MIT licence, whose text is available in the LICENSE file.

* What's here?
Below are the contents of this repository:

** =forecast.el=
«forecast.el» is a weather forecast report generator, currently using
data from [[https://darksky.net][Dark Sky]] (but I plan to add other backends in the future).

# [[./forecast.el.png]]

** =paper-theme.el=
«Paper» is a little, minimal emacs theme that is meant to be simple
and consistent.

It was first intended to resemble the look of paper, but has diverged
from that objective.  Still, though, I keep calling it Paper, as I
like that name.

Paper uses a small colour palette over all the elements.  Org headings
are specially treated with a palette of equidistant colours.  The
colours and heading font sizes are calculated using base and factor
values which can be edited.  See source.

It's most adapted for ELisp-Org users, as I'm one such user, though it
works fine with Markdown, Textile, Python, JavaScript, Html, Diff,
Magit, etc.

** =pass-listing.el=
«pass-listing» is a simple frontend to the [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]] utility.  It uses the
functions from =password-store.el=.

** =bsdpkg.el=
«bsdpkg» is an Emacs interface to FreeBSD =pkg(1)=.  It's planned to
genericise the package to support all *BSD packaging systems, and the
module is written with that sort of extensibility in mind.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This is experimental, and kind-of obsoleted as I don't use BSD at
the moment.  I'd be happy to accept changes or to hand it over if
anybody will be interested.
#+END_QUOTE

** =bibliothek.el=
«bibliothek.el» is a personal PDF library manager.  Presently it only
displays a concatenated tabular list of PDF files from many locations,
and allows to open the files or view metadata from that list.  Find
below a screenshot of the default view.  I intend to add some
functionality for moving PDF files around and editing the metadata.

** =gk-unilat.el=
«gk-unilat» is a unified input method for European variants of the
Latin alphabet.

It aims to provide comprehensive support for typing characters found
in different European versions of the Latin alphabet, in a unified,
predictable way.

** =gk-greek.el=
«gk-greek» is a transliterating input method for modern Greek.

Translates input in Greek latinization into Greek alphabet.  Mappings
are based on vocal correspondence and common modern transliteration.

** =org-variable-pitch.el=
«org-variable-pitch.el» is a minor mode that enables
‘variable-pitch-mode’ in the current Org-mode buffer, and sets some
particular faces up so that they are are rendered in fixed-width font.
Also, indentation, list bullets and checkboxes are displayed in
monospace, in order to keep the shape of the outline.

** =dollar.el=
This package provides a macro named $ where in its body symbols in the
form $N where N is a positive integer are to stand for positional
arguments to the generated lambda.

If the car of the body is a vector though, that vector becomes the
argument list of the new lambda.

Some examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
($ (message "Hello, %s" $1))
(funcall ($ (* $1 $1)) 2)
(reduce ($ [a b] (concat a b)) (list "hel" "lo"))
#+END_SRC

* Issues
Please mention the relevant filename in your issue title.

** TODO Add OVP to Melpa
SCHEDULED: <2018-04-06 Cum>

- [ ] Update [[https://github.com/cadadr/elisp/issues/31][issue#31]] on Github when you send the PR to Melpa.

** TODO dollar.el: ignore quoted expressions when looking for arguments
: ($ '$1)

Should produce

: (lambda nil '$1)

But it currently produces

: (lambda ($1) '$1)

See [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/814wis/dollarel_shorthand_lambda_notation_eg_message/dv0naiu/][this thread]] on Reddit.

** TODO dollar.el: =$*= should stand for the entire argument list
Like =&rest args=.
